# Basic Netflix Clone with React

Welcome to my basic Netflix clone project! This project is a simple attempt to recreate the landing page of Netflix using React.js. It's primarily meant as a learning exercise to practice React fundamentals.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The landing page adjusts to different screen sizes for a better user experience.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tusharkr1918/netflix-clone.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd netflix-clone
   ```

3. Open the project in your preferred code editor.

4. Run the project locally:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view the landing page.
